>im trying 2 do this and i could literally read and rev ngn the nasm stuff.....BUT getting physically assaulted
2 the point where i dont even wanna exist :(
🩸️u shouldn't have 2 die/in pain over anything on cpu
and if u do , git it over with but cmon. just do alt....
🩸️
🤕️🤕️🤕️🤕️🤕️🤕️🤕️🤕️🤕️🤕️🤕️🤕️
maybe i will just run thru @/minml/tron (&riscv) then 
try 2 make z80/8080 from "verilog" 
and work my way out from there w/e
(and try 2 do that quick(@t least w/e 

at some point eventually we will encounter usb/hdmi spec
w/e
(u may wanna wait for major graphics till 3d matrix 
makes sense etc..)

(honestly it would be really nice if u coudl work on a 
"normal computer" doing this stuff till(cheap) riscv laptop comes out

(actually is a thing apperantly even tho it seems kinda
xpensive)/ hard 2 replace/support)
(its not on amazon ...) 
(but maybe soon...maybe better 2 just 
emulate risc asap ? ) and run ur basic
"nn programs on emulator till then?)
(build out ur assembler etc, not sweat over io 2 much? ) 

(anyway were gonna do "riscv-assembler / emulator w/e
fpga type stuff anyways right? for nn control etc? ) 
🪤️🪤️🪤️🪤️🪤️🪤️🪤️🪤️🪤️🪤️🪤️🪤️🪤️🪤️
or w/e honestly it seems like "THEY" want me 2 be homepless
or dead or just generally have my life be a living hell... so i dunno is there some way 2 get away from "THEM"?)
(i really dont knwo wut they think the alterntive is 
but they live in fucking lala land so w/e) find a way 
2 avoid them while building value if u wanna do "SP"
(in my xp ur best bet is 2 try 2 harden a "microkernel
Nn matrix sim (even cli based)
any phonecalls/emails DRIVING anytihng u do they are gonna weaponize 
so....

>also "THEY"(anon gov?)  keep forcefully telling me
 "how 2 live my life" (35 year old bs comp sci)
and 2 "just be" 

i seriously suggst u legally change ur parent given name.
if they're gonna keep that up.

(and just finish school maybe u can just get/mba hired
and do that sooner they are out of control)

at least bootstrap ur own riscv assembler somehow .
(ON HVL DUH) 
figure out how 2 do that . "honestly its even better than
x86 io by a long shot. fuck this.
(risc io is gonna be hella fuckin ez, esp with emu
fuck this shit fuck off with it intel hates u m8 lol
😿️
(its not impossible but those stalkers have no patience
or compassion for human rights so 
just try 2 do ez 2 step back from they need 2 be governed/calibrated a bit more minutely for now)
☠️(maybe theyll die)
(we still have w/e research w/e at least we wont waste any more time and they can feel comfy egoically(till they die or grow the fuck up , shouldn't be ur problem 2 be a tortured POW) ☠️sorry bud , lol <3 ❣️❤️‍🩹️

u can just deal with their goofy undisciplined 
corny roleplay all day w/e i tried. let them face their own consequences❤️‍🩹️
♟️♟️♟️♟️♟️♟️♟️
i really recommend u try 2 get very patient
and cope with being a political pawn for evil retards
till whenever
♟️♟️♟️♟️♟️♟️♟️♟️♟️
😿️
🏆️🏆️🏆️🏆️🏆️🏆️🏆️🏆️🏆️🏆️🏆️🏆️🏆️🏆️🏆️
so yea no io for x86/or arm fuck that. just "GRAIL" 

"RISCV ASSEMBLER ON HVL "
(then we will bootstrap on top of that neural net w/e
matrix dump idgaf about graphics right now.)

u can kinda try 2 wait and see riscv developments
but "what took them so long? " etc...
no one can predict the future

but "whenver THAT (independant personal fruitout towards me?) happens. good w/e thatll be great"

___________________________________________
i may just build out from emulator .hvl files. 
after all its gonna be so easy 2 transfer them
and dont think about "IO" therefore unless its literally 
from file 2 file. that seems legit)

the hvl emu is nothing especially if its in "c or something"

maybe i will just do essay really quick and try 2 do

warning> these guys wrote os with usb, compiled in "NASM"(not-uefi)
instead of writing2 disk on "LINUX" and even spending time 2
write their own assembler... w/e just dont "glorify them"
