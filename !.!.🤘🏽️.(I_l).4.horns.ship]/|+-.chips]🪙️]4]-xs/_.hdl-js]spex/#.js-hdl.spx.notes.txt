what does these times "MEAN"? (From "Register.cmp")
üë®üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄÔ∏è
its not "times" its literal (16bit)values , (some are negative based on "signed/unsigned" its literally that simple
but yes it looks confusing at first) (read the full thing not just the ssnippet) [its nothing 2 do with the "loop"]
(why are they "THOSE number?" i dunno maybe function necessary for its use , just figure it out (its not "time")
(it is "DEPENDANT ON time and "input tho' ie it expects -32132 input ...(look at the TIME LINEüèÅÔ∏è
							^this is random "symbol"?
							
SUM : go 2 http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/hdl-hardware-simulator/
put register formula in and switch 2 "DECIMAL" mode and things will be more clear.

--------------
SUM : 1bit = 1flipflop just make a flip flop and see if it works. can u chain them for 
16 input? or how does that register work? does it work? *shrug* 
(do u ever SEE an example of a "LOOP" in the code they provide? just push forward pls
if theres a problem with truth tables maybe its this. 

Not (in=loop1, out=loop1)// Invalid (assumes we dont break cycle or somehting , but we cycle 1nc
DFF (in=loop2, out=loop2)

CHIP Not {
    IN in;
    OUT out;

    PARTS:
    Nand(a=out, b=in, out=a);
  
} 
also ran this in js-hdl and it didn't break (but maybe java is setup diff w/e move on pls) 
(keep an eye out tho w/e) 
(i looked up a "real shift register" and saw " real ouputs" but hey make one 
and we will try 2 compare it 2 "real sreg" (its just 16/32 flip flops why wouldn't it work?)
shh just do it

(i think it maybe something super technical ) 
end of discussion tho tbh

but how can it output a "negative time" wut is the interpretation of that?
(is that even what it does ? (in sim? for who/what?)

(not SUPER CLEAR but i dont think it will be a problem, just make the chips and we will see then)
(theres always other external help for clocked/cpu making (4bit8bit w/e) 
(if necessary we can chain clock 2 sys clock &| compare clock times @ logic w/e) 
(i dont think thats necessary )
(it literally may not matter cux their compiler may work diff than ours tbh)
(what is the ACTUAL truth table for a "REGISTER"? (NOT THE NAND? Compare them)
(anyway we already have clock set up w/e it is its ez compared 2 how clk was 2 setup) <4cel ofc


#============================================
Not (in=loop1, out=loop1) // Invalid
DFF (in=loop2, out=loop2) // Valid

*think about this (loop means that at some point it goes back in (if nothing is clocked, 
shouldn't be "allowed" 

read page 291 for better xplain

(what would it do "IRL?"
can u make one quick and see wussup? (their acting a fool im bout 2 send them 2 bed
im not even worried about this its not an excuse 2 torture a human

(i dont htink aour compiler is set up like theirs (wire wise) 
but ur free 2 look i think ur good tho its not magic (magic is even easier 2 code tbh ;) 
(*ours doesn't move at lightspeed if theres nothing on wire it "_" if thers something it goes
i really dont understand the problem could be but maybe later i will

(i think its a "Nothing(noprob)" and i think u should leave that garbage javascript alone)
