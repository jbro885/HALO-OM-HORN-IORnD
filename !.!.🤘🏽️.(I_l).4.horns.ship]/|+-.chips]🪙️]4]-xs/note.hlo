making "register & shiftreg(4DFPGA) + 8way mux (for both but DFPGA IS 8bit[vs16])




















DONE___________________
i dont think the mux u have will work ... unless it does...
#but ur gonna be throwing a "11" into it which is gonna have side fx (ew didn't think about)
#u may rather use a mux made of "nunq" 2 rule out edge cases !
#"KDFF" is using nunq cept for a "NOT" which doesn't matter...
#(nunq always auto turns "11's into 0, which doesn't explain why it doesnt' work tho...
(who knows wut mux is doing :/ ) (will bit even work? save bad bit and we can revisit it.) 

*rationally speaking the problem PROBABLY is u didn't use "TXNANDS" 2 make ur "MUX"
u just used "W/e worked..."

#make ur "ground 'chip'" and just do 1_3/2_3= 0 (u can even do 3_3=3 still make sense?) 
(and its like were feeding power in THAT like our breadboard line!  
#wow an actual realistic use case for that, what are the chances!? ;) 
protip : reps a completed circuit instead of "off"

#🧟‍♂️️
ugly problems require ugly sols ;)
#🧟‍♂️️

#ground chip maybe cool but ur solution shouldn't be 2 turn the number 2 "0" every time...
(that was naive af , sorry)NEVER would THAT be the answer. 
#maybe if its 3,3...otherwise i think it should pass the "1 |  2"...
#if 3&0 then maybe pass the 0 (honestly i think u want 3&3 2 be 3  
but 2 take a 0 as default and pass w/o & zero...


just "complete the circuit"
but first get ur "DFF" back.dont even thinkg about ground...
