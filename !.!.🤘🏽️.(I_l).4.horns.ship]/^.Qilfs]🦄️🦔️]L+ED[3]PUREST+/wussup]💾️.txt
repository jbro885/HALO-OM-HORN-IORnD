  1.just replacing the old in quilo with this new one
  2.can it load "INTO quilo?" GOAL...

📆️4.13.24}
no longer crashes , but is making new inode instead of storing , imo. 
(was 2 diff problems , ez fix tbh, lets go)
📮️seems like its actually writing after the "buffers limits" 
instead of moving 2 front of new inode...
(can we exit after inode is made or w/e first💡️ ;) ? 
 📮️
📆️4.12.24 (16.15)=🏚️i dont get the top malloc error anymore. 
maybe cuz i have been allocating and freeing memory . maybe it will return but for now
i think everything is fine BUT
✍️its writing out data in the wrong place (not the inodes block , just in main/dir ✍️
obv thats all my fault somehow ; its not magic ✍️

📆️4.12.24 =🤓️i dont even think its the "system(exes)" cuz they've neever been a problem 
so it may not be that bad :/ (u could probably diagnose by swapping one of hte earlier mallocs and leaveing the later one ;) (>as opposed 2 using "GDB/GHIDRA LMFAO") ;
ps dont use that "all free()" thats just a distraction and its gone <3z🔍️🤓️
👨🏾‍🏫️if worse comes 2 worse, just dont use malloc. evertime i replace malloc with 
# the code works till next malloc. (or go backwards and see which "corrupted"
 w/e its not magic👨🏾‍🏫️
 📦️i wanted 2 allocate in a seperate function like i did for the 
 "program files(they never corrupted...)
 i think its header mallocs that "keep using or w/e same "memory /namespace"
 make it corrupt ez. i dont think we actually ran into this b4 therefore and its a 
 new problem. 
 but it doesn't explain why inodes worked at some point(not provable!<but not anymore...)🏚️w/e they will work after this, they obv werent gonna work ....🏠️ 📦️

 ⚙️buffer is good 2 go but im not sure that inodes were setup right or something?  
 📮️i nodes are fine and data wrote 2 file but file is corrupt... why?

🍍️makes inode and first block is corrupt with ' �]��]��]��]��] '
w/e lets printf(dump) b4 it dumps2.txt,  and we'll see wuts happening.
📮️its going 2 file malformed. should be ez fix📮️

📅️3.31.24= 🦔️

everything will come in , convert 2 binary , at be in inode.]
(inode will pass 2 load from [arg]later can make "ux")
🏗️
(its gonna be ascii , but if u can eventually steal "unicode/hex"
from xxd, great, same mechanism theoretically . so ... ASCII 1rst

⚙️ there was no mech for loading in asci [EVER]. 
>so, im gonna build it from scratch taking peices from 🦾️
only if we need them⚙️
