PRIME EXAMPLE:

halo will consume the "KBD.txt" as INPUT
and OUTPUT to "SCREEN" so... 
having them in same file would be 
"DUMB AS HELL"

sum: always think in terms of "HALO.IO"

KEY LOGGER WILL WORK(S) but it must be 
"SUPER" to everything else 
(unless u use it outside the binary , but 
i dont think  u should right now)

IE:  put "sigWINchframe[🪟️] IN KEY LOGGER' 
then PUT "3DFPS " in "WINDOW[that is in KL]"

TANGENTIALLY?/ SUPREMELY? 
could consume keyboard has child process
(in MACRO CLI)
(as well as LANCHING SEPERATE VIEW WINDOW)
(AND THEN CONSUME "GAME" AS GRANDCHILD..)
(this was always the plan and it actually makes sense
since ur cli is gonna do other things
(stock prices/ manage gigapet wallets / edit sheets etc...

*but u might need some tiem understanding how 2 
"manage child processes"
ofc this may be the appropriate time 2 do that

"ALL AT ONCE..."

(i also think it helps keep team "MACRO FOCUSED/
(sol penned, instead of scatter brained"

*y not b4 ? !(we didn't really have any data 2 consume cept yahoo.json or dummy data , ofc
now is a WONDERFUL time <3 ,❤️‍🔥️ !HAVE FUN!!!❤️‍🔥️
