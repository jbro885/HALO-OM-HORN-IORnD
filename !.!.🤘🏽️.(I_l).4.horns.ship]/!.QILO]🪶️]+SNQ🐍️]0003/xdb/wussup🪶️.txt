even a "game mmemory of "frames" would start with "TID" & "change count ;)

jan20:
💭️its probably time 2 look at cliopt 2 get ur threadign(argv) code back <3💭️
🎩️[atop(rolling)= launch(targeting kbd),pass tid->"proq-maker"->pass mem addr (returned)2 kbd [run kbd in background] (or do THIS urself manually) ]
🎩️[atop(choose-process-2-render)= launch, 'show_all_running_procs.c' ->pass choice 2 "render.c" (exiting should go back 2 "all_run.c"<-cuz macro threading(example in cliopt) ]
👑️(all cliopt does is allow u 2 try 2 launch "exe"(macro or micro)
and remain in "macrothreads"(even SUPER MACRO THREAD)
{u know this is tight if u can open cliopt from cliopt and not crash/overheat}
👑️
1.tid from cliargv.txt or "Macroprogram(pthreadder)" otherwise makeup rand 4 debug.(and can dynamically make if doesn't exit in mem..., otherwise wasn't mem maker supposed 2 make that???)
struct = [tid,wr-cnt,{mt-symbolically}data]
https://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html
❗️the actual struct were making so fare looks much diff/simplr than this , but dont worry, and dont forget 2 wrap in blockchain<3 ❗️
⏳️ext2 fs doesn't record "# of changes" it records
time since last change...(which would match with "blockchain
tho i do think blockcahin would correspond 2 #'s of blox/txs?)
:lets try this FIRST. and even go for "psudo-QUARTZ clock CHAINING"
: u may keep a kbd buffer (in mem)b4 writing based on 
(clock, u may restruct how kbd works a bit , w/e)

Kell wants 2 do it "rite" coulda fooled me with all the phy assault..

KLOCK will be used A TON. so just go for it...

remember if EVERYTHING chains 2 clock its great for "NN/Debugging"
⏳️
2.?{tid goes into kbd argv}
3. render from tid (based on tid list) [as ascii!]
(from menu program that shows all running procs(aka tids ;)
(they maybe labled human readable in "TXTFS STRUCTURE")

4.cli's job is actually very lite. (and dependson "kbd")
will be its own proc. but can be launched as macroproc i guess...

(json should be done 4 compiler struct primiatives 
and blockchain/versioning are literally mex... 

choose 3d/2d matrix render. color or ascii. (open gl?) 
\(more than one? splitting hdmi sig? ) 
and thats pretty fuckin sic...

👨🏽‍🚀️jan19: sol = strstr()👨🏽‍🚀️

🤷🏻‍♀️️
*the tid maker can scan dir first or w/e 
🤓️
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-list-files-sub-directories-directory/
🤯️we actually use this for cli wtf how did i forget that!!?🤯️
🤓️
(u just strstr() each "scan" or w/e
were comparing against tid made, may not even be necessary
🍍️for now, lets just make some tid based on real tid *input?  or hash w/e (can be random # for now)🍍️
💋️KISS💋️
🤷🏻‍♀️️
📅️jan19: need 2 switch "binConverter.h" 2 use "int" instead of "8"[should be ez(CUZ PRIMS) if u readover the code again.]✅️


then we will "input tid.txt " and front  padd.
(this should be super simple )
🤯️🧠️⚡️🚨️🤯️🧠️⚡️🚨️🤯️🧠️⚡️🚨️🤯️🧠️⚡️🚨️🍍️🍍️🍍️🍍️🍍️
*[going 4th]even if u WANT 2 use "txt[0].txt" DONT pass .txt
(just pass a "tid" and we will interpret it as a 'nonfile'
(by doing "sizeof(and counting 4back = .txt or not)
u actually pass 'nontxt'(tid) and strcat".txt"
u only pass "filename, if was created file as a "FILE.tid"

{😰️<kell actin fool?<Just actin fool they need 2 learn boundaries and they will 🔍️ ❌️were keeping backups all over and WILL congeal code so its all good.
🧸️could be even better if u got our diff/git working...🧸️
 ❌️}

📅️jan18: - were gonna make aspects of kilo ourself , wuts the diff 
between that and "SNAKE"? lets find out. 
📅️
🗓️

🏘️🏘️🏘️
🛖️
>take kbd
>render section of mem . (can render entire file
or just call it w/e 
💡️
< we can really "figure out render " here
(were not reading from "KBD buffer" were creating
a "QILO buffer"< thats kinda a secret 
🧝‍♂️️
(u may need a macro program 2 read from that mem
just create as many processes as u need. 
i wouldnt even mind 
'reading it as a process'
(just like if you WERE reading "KDB BUFFER")🧝‍♂️️
💡️
>update in buffer <according 2 kilo 
>update in realtime < according 2 qlockchain/teddy-git ... 
🛖️
◽️KILO ARCH = 
⌨️some of this will cross over 4 basic "KBDFX"⌨️
▫️ re-render screen after keypress
(this has 2 do with knowing key changed 
which we were talking about b4 i left)
(the kbd'mem block' knowing about "itself"
'NAMELY = KEYES PRESSED SINCE INCEPTION'
❔️
(how are they rendering it different than i or "snake"?{snake=fake}
❔️
👩🏻‍🏭️
(ittle just take up 8bits up front, 
and we can keep adding and pushing back 
4 things we need and if we dont use (ext2)
that will justtify missing space <3 
👩🏻‍🏭️

🎫️🎟️
can take in "proc mon file" , or just write 2 txt[0000]

*i think im gonna write 2 both seperate file AND txt[0000]
and see how it goes. 

(other args will be)

📽️🎞️(we can reverse engineer render to output w/e input file (which updates on its own)
then kbd threading can update that file (or blockchain w/e)
therefore render just needs 2 read from "id 
eather as inode or file)

(2 do fs u can just make multiple kbd instances or w/e)
📽️🎞️
🎟️🎫️
process maker ? just make blank space (or file)
(in file system , logs in filesystem header 
(or a proc mon file? (or expects management
by macroprograms mem? 


>do we have ANY info about "txtfs header size? we may throw in .h or carry around? "⛓️Maybe in chain wussup⛓️
👩🏻‍🏫️*we could reuse header if u got more lineraly organized...👩🏻‍🏫️
