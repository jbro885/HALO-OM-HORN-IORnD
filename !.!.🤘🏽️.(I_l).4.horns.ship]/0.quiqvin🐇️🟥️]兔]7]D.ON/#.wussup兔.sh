      this is very helpful . 
      
      at this point i would "STOP" (its not metadata , id rather it was)
      (and u get the color not from "is digit" but is there color data 
      (at that "chars" meta data adress < way more meaningful long term) 
      
      first of all , our renderer is supposed 2 render from "binary.pro"
      (that gets written on EVERY KEY PRESS process
      (instead of rendering from buffer (it is a buffer)
      and ur on ur own with that... but maybe u can edit buffer as ascii
      (after pull) then convert it back 2 binary pre pull for closests fx. 
      we dont need 2 reinvent the wheel. and we will continue that 
      framework 4 support. + nino is doing its thing and we 'NEED MOUSE'🖱️/
      collapsing menus,tabs,(the [crosscompatible] framework for that stuff even when oneday tansfered 2 "FB" etc . 
      
      ⏰️go do new renderer, make sure it pushes / pulls from new 0.pro
      before getting fancy  , will probably pivot 2 snake/neural/netsnake. b4 fancy so... yea *yes me playing against neural net snake ai on sockets ;) <3❤️[thru p2p , or server lobby]. its not about the programs beefing up . its all about neural  nets. neural nets want "versioning"🧸️ so then do that after. 
      
      MBA wants "yahoofin" which should come after(4 syngergzing of stocks onto a valuechain) exchange of meaningful value with peers (ie crypto tokens), so get into that quickly aswell ⏰️

🐛️BUGS[not fixed, priority order]

!. for debugging i no longer can see "key pressed" in mem cuz it overwrites 
after 0. this can be  done away with if u use time checking. 
(we didn't cuz it was redundant? )

///⏰️⏰️⏰️⏰️⏰️⏰️  
 //  if(previousTimeDec < currentTimeDec){
 // this guys renderer is BAD remember? lets start over and make our own renderer
 // THAT IS TIMEWISE> (we can always finish kilo stuff if we want with more 
// control / understanding  , pre porting NINO stuff... 
//⏰️⏰️⏰️⏰️⏰️⏰️
💩️we could push forwared even with bugs for w/e reason but ur just piling bad on top of bad and u dont know wuts going on . so just make ur new renderer. 💩️
?.
#闹
#u  get the best of both worlds. u get ur own renderer and u get 2 fix kilo bugs
#that were depending on ignorant noncompatible rendering <3 
#闹
"when arrows are "double pressed" , writes "["
(is kbdmem registering a different char ? speed "VTIME" can chage that i think)
?. delete/backspace isn't working quite right
?. dirty doesn't triple check...








🆘️just use the "structs" 2 get bootstrapped. then u can swap 2 ints w/e. at least u will grok 
ur souce blueprint...🆘️
🔂️SIDEQUEST (the window "NEVER DYNAMICALLY SIZES!" (we have one that does) can we mod it now!?
🐢️u maybe wait till ur done with the rest 2 do this so not 2 create confusion ? <3💝️ 🐢️

📮️it looks like risc arrow are mapped the same? even tho that makes no sense...
something is or was up but were not going into it right now. 
📮️
🀄️riscv arrows are mapped different . but i have 
#ifdef(_riscv_) so were gonna fix it when we do "+cntrl"
cuz "PERF TIMING"🔍️⛪️(were on track) feb[2]2024🀄️





🐡️watch out for which proc something should be in . 
there talking about
🌎️ "global state" >we may divirge in our approcah so try reading ahead, in bed or w/e

📤️DONE📤️ we aren't keeping a "pure calender" cuz this stuff isn't that hard...📤️


🏓️just get "size of window" (either way) ;) then rendering buffer should be EZ AF so LETS GO!🏓️

❤️‍🩹️i cleared mem{strcopy filenames cuz ur using args cuased unneeded confusion...}<> (we get flicker render now but there gonna help with that. were good.) 
🤕️ its storing "exit-cmnd" so as soon as program starts, it exits... NOT GOOD!

do we clear mem 2 "0" for exit commands? 
seems fair if u do it from second program(quil)
🤕️
❤️‍🩹️
❤️‍🩹️ fixed= 🩹️fixed kill (die) fx is workign so w/e thats wut tutorial uses so how can it be that wrong?

🐡️"cntrl-q" works WONDERFULLY , but "contrl-c" only works in '1.kbd2.mem]⌨️🎫️]0002' i think its cuz i didn' t "dissable cntrl" in "quil" i probably 
should..., and even make 'raw' extern...

(  i added term stuff and it didn't make a differnce . no thanks.) 
(no it doesn't help if i put it in "MACROMAN" also it doesn't even ever
let me hit cntrl-c so just use that as emergency 4 now? or w/e ) 
IF ANYTHIGN U CAN CHANGE QUIT TIME NOW 2 BE A BIT FASTER W/E {BREAKTIME !}
 🩹️

u should rewind 2 "CLEARN SCREEN"
and also "RETURN TERM 2 PRESTATE" (So it doesn't freeze!)]POST
📬️
i did that and its fine, the problem is 
kilo is in "1 scope" but our system is in "2 scopes" so we need 2 header
❎️extern struct ? https://cboard.cprogramming.com/c-programming/29913-extern-structs.html❎️
{i would even suggest shaking struct out 2 vars but w/e it was in  a diff struct b4.. u can wait till u get good not like ur gonna add ur own structs}
the "termios struct/die() , THAT may fix our problems from here on out
everything else will hopefully be copy/paste/grok <3 (its 3am.bed now<3)🔍️

💡️i wonder if it would be better to send "kill-sig" 2 mem? 4 (1.kbd)?💡️
🪄️is is better/POSSIBLE? 2 somehow chain proccesses 2 gether "so if one dies the 
other does aswell (in macro code???)

💉️the "Best perscription" seemed 2 be to make ur own "kill" based on mem or something (were sharing keypresses so u may already be doing it 'right' tbh)💉️
🤯️
*the actually problem is using "cntrQ" 2 quit is "KEYBOARD THREAD"
because? the signal dosen't get sent 2 mem so other thread CANT READ IT!'

❤️‍🩹️i actually think this is fixed. theres a state where it works PERFECTLY... 
i tested recompiled and it works just like u would want. a dream i dunno how , but i dont care.

(it didn't quit on cntrl c, but grabs key.. thats exactly wut u wanted...) i dunno HOW...
im investigating

☢️i had one where i put "raw mode" on all 3 and cntrl-c still "bugged it out" 
i will look for a more elegant solutions while leaving "well enough " alone 4 now <3 
(i saved that version aaway in "ray tank"
