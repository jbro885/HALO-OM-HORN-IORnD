//📅️2.23.24 <-saturday 00:35   = kinda lost? but i know i left a clean enviornment

📰️will keep u posted📰️
📮️?

🤷🏻‍♂️️
i THINK we need 2 go in 2.qi.lngn]🖌️🦾️]0000.c and make it read from superblock
 and make an inode entry or something
🤷🏻‍♂️️

(inode was registering in "mom/*" but i moved it into pro🦾️ . but
maybe thats bad cuz it was there cuz race condition . w/e ez fix. 

🍍️where are we NOW!? u just need 2 work thru 2.qi.lngn]🖌️🦾️]0000.c
and make sure its passing the right args or cheat reading them we/ 
then u can literally run kbd again and set up inode mult. 
(if its already on w/e no big deal)

🍍️
📮️i really wish this was at  a"FULL THRU " point... (soon was the point)
