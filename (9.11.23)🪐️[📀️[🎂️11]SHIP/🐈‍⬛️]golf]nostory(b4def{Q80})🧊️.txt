You may have toxoplasma gondii floating around in your body right now. What is this? Toxoplasma gondii, or “toxo,” may not convert a cat-hater to a crazy cat person. The parasite does, however, have the ability to warp your mind, potentially in a way that makes you absolutely love cats!Oct 22, 2022

Save the Cat! Beat Sheet
Beat #1: Opening Image. (0-1)%
🐈‍⬛️<blac cat (cats w/e (going 2 by end be like tenchis spaceship)
Ryo-Ohki (魎皇鬼, Ryōōki)(is a half cat half rabbit {DIGI=HALOMON+-}

"HN"(cat-bunny :can be diff newjeans at diff tymes w/e :) 


This is the first beat of Act 1 and it serves as a “before” snapshot of your main character (who from here on out I will refer to as the “hero” of your story), where you visually show, in a single scene, who your hero is and what their world or life is like.

*q8 has halo , already . (horn liek ears..?xocat?)

🐈‍⬛️> 

Beat #2: Theme Stated (5%)

This is where a statement is made by a character (typically not the hero) that hints at what the hero’s arc will be (that is, what the hero must learn/discover before the end of the book). This can also be referred to as a “life lesson.”

🐈‍⬛️> 


Beat #3: Setup (1% – 10%)

These scenes are used to explore the hero’s status quo life and all its flaws. This is where the reader learns more about what the hero’s life looks like before its epic transformation, including how your hero’s life is flawed in some way. Here we also introduce other supporting characters and the hero’s primary goal. But most important, we show the hero’s reluctance to change (aka learn the theme or life lesson) while also hinting at the stakes at risk should the hero not change.

(literally becomes k80 before BEAT 4 . and now needs 2 get "IO"
the b4.death . and real worls

🐈‍⬛️> jumping from different dying into new dimensions constantly sometiems
even reincarnating etc (different animated style of same kat) 

🐈‍⬛️> needs a solid thread needs 2 weave their own thread, take on traits of 
SPIDER BOSS🕷️ (cat can grow more legs or w/e now (8bit) and spin wire)[can do more legs even 64 but has 2 watch4 "MEMORIES" ] 
its new name is "Q80"((for more) [Q8088];)[can resize so yea , w/e]

(it has the ability to do io now maybe easier, tho it could have probably 
still done it before by strning memories toegether (PAGING) 
but maybe now it can go faster or w/e ) 

🐈‍⬛️> 

Beat # 4 – Catalyst (10%)

> CATALYST < (cataclysm DDA? ) 

At 10%, an inciting incident (or life-changing event) should happen to the hero, which will catapult them into a new world or new way of thinking. This is an action beat that should be big enough to prevent the hero from being able to return to their status quo life. (things like break-ups, deaths, firings, and invitations are popular choices.)

🧊️
"BEING A CAT IN CATACLYSM DDA CLONE3d minecraft mod w/e block chaining etc. "(twist abstract FROM cataclysm/zombi ?, yes sneakking like MGSV. .. 
(finding trading objects{zelda?}? foraging surviving? miniquests etc...
*building "value" manipualting situations 2 try 2 "gain leverage w/o being able 2 spend money etc (its a qat after all...)(it cant spend money but
ppl its trying 2 "manipulate" can so if she helps them get rich or something
and they dont know it was them (get cot) she can keep "using" them (politically?) 
(what do the "PEOPLE" around want / need that can be leveraged, can that
be resarched etc? and used 2 have better "QUALITY OF LIFE?" / positioning onself? *spiritually(even sin) ANd otherwise..) 

*it can only like string 2gether rube goldberg "Logic gates" type things with different things around (can eventually even hook into power lines/ phone lines etc (text ppl? use computer? tbh why not ;)
(can even use "SELF DRIVING CAR" < SONU ;) *helping lucky & astrx* ;? 
*(ye shes gonna help him git lots of "GFS" and clones and robots & biznesses and stuff (but maybe we kinda dont know who he is yea or w/e its ok)🧊️
eventually even a spaceship >'Q8madake') 
(at this point its able to create a back 2 the future like device 2 jump 
in AND out of "dimensions" (being pink or black (and maybe make a collar or something(out of an iwatch) and be "tiger stripped?"  
(btw there were ways 2 do io before but she wants like infinite access )
🔍️and ill just leave it at that🔍️
[🧊️]

Beat #5: Debate (10% to 20%)

After the Catalyst, the hero usually takes multiple scenes or chapters to react to what happened in the Catalyst. This is a sequence in which the hero debates what they will do next. It’s usually presented in the form of a question (such as “Should I go?” or “What do I do?”). The purpose of this beat is to show the hero’s reluctance to change.


Beat #6: Break Into 2 (20%)

This is the moment when the hero decides to accept the call to action, leave their comfort zone, try something new, or venture into a new world or new way of thinking. It’s a decisive action beat that separates the status quo world of Act 1 from the new “upside-down” world of Act 2, which we are now in! It’s at this moment that a new or modified goal is typically introduced, something that the hero is pursuing through the first half of Act 2.

🐈‍⬛️> begins creating this new world 

Beat #7: B Story (22%)

At this point in the story, we introduce a new character or characters who will ultimately serve to help the hero learn the theme or life lesson. This can also be referred to as a helper character, and it can come in the form of a love interest, nemesis, mentor, family member, friend, or other!

🐈‍⬛️>🐕️< marzak dog {lab dog} ? Y not tbh i would rather have sp names and lose them if u want . this can be that pointer 2 the mac-multiverse tree we made
where entire "dimension tree" has 2 be stored somewhere, its on the back of dog. (cat can shrink down and ride the dog which actually exist "MORE IN A SOLID REALITY " (cuz its owner is alive or something bizaare) 

Beat #8 : Fun and Games (20% to 50%)

In this long sequence of multiple scenes or chapters is where we see the hero in their new “upside down” world of Act 2. They’re either generally loving it or hating it. Succeeding or floundering. We want to see the hero pursuing that goal you set up at the Break into 2, so this is where you show the hero either making strides to achieve that goal or struggling to achieve that goal. This beat is also called the “promise of the premise” because it’s the section of the story that represents the “hook” of the novel, in other words, (why the reader picked up the novel in the first place).

🐈‍⬛️> cat controlling the dog like rataoillie to get out of the geratrix mind and acuatually building reality of world enough 2 get into a "healthy human brain" 

Beat #9: Midpoint (50%)

This is literally the middle of the novel where the Fun and Games culminates in either a “false victory” (the hero has thus far been succeeding and/or has achieved their goal) or a “false defeat” (the hero has thus far been floundering and/or has lost their goal). But something else should happen here to raise the stakes and push the hero forward, ultimately toward real change. (Plot twists, time clocks, ramp-ups of the love story are popular choices.)

🐈‍⬛️> the human is entropist and is doing bad things 2 try 2 sabatouge the entire lab {they are gonna put the dog 2 sleep . and the reality kat has been building would be completely wasted as a failed big bang.collapse }


Beat #10: Bad Guys Close In (50% to 75%)

If the Midpoint was a false victory, this section of the story will generally be a downward path where things get progressively worse for the hero. If the Midpoint was a false defeat, this section will generally be an upward path where things seem to get progressively better for the hero. But regardless of path, the hero’s deep-rooted flaws (or internal bad guys) are closing in. After the Midpoint, the hero typically has either a new or modified goal to pursue throughout this beat.
Beat #11: All Is Lost (75%)

This moment is the lowest point of the novel. It’s an action beat where something happens to the hero that, combined with their internal bad guys, pushes the hero to rock bottom. There’s typically a “whiff of death” during this beat, meaning something dies here (either literally or metaphorically) to symbolize the “death of the old hero” and upcoming “rebirth of a transformed hero"

🐈‍⬛️> the mind the kat was living from dies so its reality is decaying faster so it has 2 make the new reality work , but their gonna kill the dog. also for w/e reason 2 examne its brain because is a drestrutive way they can understand why its been acting SO DIFFERENTLY 

Beat #12: Dark Night of the Soul (75% to 80%)

This is another reaction beat where the hero takes time to process everything that’s happened thus far. The hero should be worse off than at the start of the novel. This feels like the darkest hour for the hero, but it’s just darkness before the dawn, or the moment right before the hero finds a solution to their problems, but also finally learn their theme or life lesson.
Beat #13: The Break Into 3 (80%)

The “aha!” moment. This is where the hero realizes what they must do to not only fix the problems created in Act 2, but more important, fix themself and be “reborn” as an improved version of themselves. The character arc is nearly complete.
Beat #14: The Finale (80% to 99%)

influence the world around the ppl with the clothes. trying 2 manage all tehse 
spinning plates int the "FASHION WORLD"

Now in Act 3, the hero must prove that they really have learned the theme and have transformed. To do that we, show them enacting the plan they came up with in the Break Into 3. Bad guys are destroyed, flaws are conquered, lovers are reunited. Not only is the hero’s world saved, but it’s a better place than it was before.

🐈‍⬛️> the cat gets the dog adopted by whoever{a meta being "ANGEL"[le-serrafims?] } and the dog actually leaves {THE DIMENSION / ALIVE by a being even abstract and meta who IS ALREADY CONTROLLING A FAKE HUMAN and circle of humans that literally isn't even real (shadow ppl) that pop out to a diff dimension as micro ppl with more "PURE BODIES"(i like to think about le-serafims;)"FAKE ANGELS" Sub angels/demons w/e "IDOLS;" 
*********HEY WE HAVE REAL WORLD CHARAS NOW :P;)*******************}
and the cat was working so hard incase the dog died as backplan its made the dimension into a 'shadow human' now like a humanoid shadow able 2 do its own things and its kinda like a ghost or something. and it can interfere with stuff in the real world and tie it 2 these other dimensions and try 2 get them 2 be more real or w/e by sharing trading energy etc. 
and its having them do more work with dna and it wants it to make these bio matter generators 2 beable 2 make human body parts cuz it wants its own body or even many bodies. 

Beat #15: Final Image (99% to 100%)

A mirror to the Opening Image, this is the “after” snapshot of who the hero is after going through this epic and satisfying transformation. In this final beat we show a visual representation of the hero’s life after this exciting journey has changed them for the better.

 

showing that they are getting the matter generator 2 do cool stuff w/e 

kots teaches them 2 writes stories or w/e of their own 2 macro manage 
their own worlds workloads 2 merge them towards the GOAL "metal sun" whip.
